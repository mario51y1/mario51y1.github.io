Hi! My name is Mario. I'm a software developer in Spain who just likes to talk about whatever interests me, currently trying to learn about robotics. Nonetheless, expect a lot of different topics in the blog!

Also, if you want to have a look at the notes that I take while I study you can do it on my [Zettlekasten Page]({% link _pages/notes.md %})

This website is currently under construction, so if you find something buggy or incorrect feel free to tell me!

<sub>Well, this is awkward... I currently don't have any real post so... Look at this cool samples<sub>
