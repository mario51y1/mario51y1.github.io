# Infra-red sensors are used in motors as shaft encoders to keep track of rotation

Inside a motor, there is usually an infrared sensors that works as
either a reflectance sensor or as a break-beam sensors that is used to
measure the amount of rotation of a motor. This is called a shaft
encoder, and by using two sensors you can also have the direction of the
rotation.

Break-beam shaft-encoders use a notched disk that when rotates goes into
the beam. Reflective shaft encoders use a disk with black and white
colors that reflects or not the light. The quality of the encoder (more
notches or black-white zones, for example) will determine the precision
of the measurement.
