# Design Patterns - Visitor

Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object
structure. Elements pass themselves to the Operation object, and this
later one performs the operation.

For example, an object structure has elements with price/size, and you
want to retrieve full cost or size of all elements. You could define the
operation on each single element, and compose them, but you could also
create a SumAll class that goes visiting all elements and adding the
total cost.

If you are going to be constantly adding new Classes, these methods will
be hard to maintain. On the other hand, if the collection of objects is
difficult that is modified but you want to keep adding operations, itâ€™s
easier to create Visitor classes than to implement the new method on
every class when creating a new operation.
