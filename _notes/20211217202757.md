# Robot behaviors

In robotics, behaviors are a mapping between sensory data and actions.
This behaviors:

-   Achieve or maintain a goal
-   Are time extended
-   Can take input from sensors or from other behaviors
-   Are more complex than single actions
-   Are executed in parallel

Another key property of the systems is that there are complex behaviors
that can appear from the combination of simple ones, sometimes
unexpectedly, which are called **emergent behaviors**.
[20210713103850](/notes/20210713103850)

On of the key points when using behaviors is how to decide, among all
the behaviors, if many of them are activated how to combine or select
between them.

The research and adaptation of animal behaviors [20211229192654](/notes/20211229192654)
in the robotic field made the reactive paradigm emerge on 1980
[20210711201545](/notes/20210711201545) and also, after that, help on the research of
hybrid architectures [20210711201605](/notes/20210711201605).

Behaviors can be defined using schema theory [20211229200605](/notes/20211229200605) and
can be easily mapped into code using Object Oriented Programming
[20220126192156](/notes/20220126192156).

## Designing a behavior based system

The steps for designing a behavioral system, taken from Behavior-Based
Robotics (Arkin 1998), are:

1.  Describe the task
2.  Describe the robot
3.  Describe the environment
4.  Describe how the robot should act in response to its environment
5.  Implement and refine each behavior
6.  Test each behavior independently
7.  Test behaviors together

The first steps introduce the constraints for the implementation, and
the last three are less abstract steps. What is often considered more an
art is the point number 4, which is to describe how the robot should
act.
