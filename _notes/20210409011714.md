# Design Patterns - Iterator

Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially
without exposing itâ€™s internal representation. DOing so enables the
capability to iterate in many different ways the same object by
replacing the operator with another one.

The best way to do so is to create a CreateIterator in the aggregate
object that returns the iterator to the client, and this oses this one
to traverse the object.
