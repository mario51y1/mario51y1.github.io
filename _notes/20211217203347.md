# Intelligent agent

An intelligent agent is an autonomous and self-contained entity which is
able to perceive itâ€™s environment, process what is perceiving and act on
consequence to achieve some goals.

The concept of agent was defined to compare different intelligent
systems, to encapsulate biological and artificial ones. A dog, a frog or
a human are agents, but so are software agents and robots

The correspondence on intelligence between agents can be addressed with
the computational theory [20211217202959](/notes/20211217202959).

The fundamental block of intelligence by scientist is the behavior
