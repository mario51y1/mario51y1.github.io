# Bayes theorem

Bayes theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior
knowledge or conditions that might be related to an event.
$$
P(A|B)=\\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

*P*(*A*) is the prior, the probability of an event *A*. *P*(*B*) is the
marginal probability. *P*(*B*|*A*) is the likelihood and finally
*P*(*A*|*B*) corresponds to the posterior probability.

## Example: smoking and having cancer

Suppose that the probability of having cancer *P*(*A*) = 0.05. We know
that people who smoke *P*(*B*) = 0.1 have a higher probability of having
cancer, and we know that from the people who have cancer, 20% of them
are smokers *P*(*B*|*A*) = 0.2.

Now, if we want to know someone probability of having cancer, we already
have that since *P*(*A*) = 0.05. However, if we know that this person
also smokes, we can use bayes theorem to update our beliefs (having
cancer):

$$
P(A|B)=\\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}=\\frac{0.2\*0.05}{0.1}=0.1
$$
With new evidence, our beliefs have changed.

## Bayes rule for independent multiple observations

$$
P(H|s\_1,s\_2,...,s\_n)=\\frac{P(s\_1,s\_2,...,s\_n|H)P(H)}{P(s\_1,s\_2,...,s\_n|H)P(H)+P(s\_1,s\_2,...,s\_n|\\neg H)P(\\neg H)}
$$
