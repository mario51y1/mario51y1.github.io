# Design Patterns - Interpreter

Given a language, define a representation for itâ€™s grammar along with an
interpreter, which interprets sentences in that language. For example,
RegEx.

You can use a class for each grammar rule, and expressions in the
language will be built by building an object composed of sentences and
rules, each one with an interpret method. Suitable for simple grammars.
When using complex grammars, it is better to switch to a proper parser.
