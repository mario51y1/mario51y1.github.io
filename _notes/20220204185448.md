# Color segmentation and color histograms

Color segmentation [20210709195948](/notes/20210709195948) is a common technique used on
robotics [20210602191112](/notes/20210602191112) due to being a fast technique that
provides good results. The image is segmented into a binary image where
regions with the desired color (values are between certain thresholds)
are marked. We can then try to measure, for example, the biggest region
or the center of the defined region.

This technique is, however, dependent on the environment lighting leves,
as rooms with more or less light intensity require different thresholds.

Another technique are color histograms. Color histograms measure each of
the pixels and categorizes them into “buckets,” each one representing a
certain color. We can use this histograms to detect if there is a
certain object of interest, as we can comprare different histograms, one
for the current image and one for a certain objective with a certain
histogram.
