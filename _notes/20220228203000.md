# Sonar basic sensor model

![Sonar sensor model](../img/basicsonarmodel.gif)

The basic sensor model [20220228202551](/notes/20220228202551) has a field of view
specified by *Î²*, the maximum width of the cone, and *R*, the maximum
range. The cone is projected into the occupancy grid, and measurements
will fall into a cell of the grid on a specific region. On each region
the measurement:

-   I: elements are probably occupied.
-   II: elements are probably empty.
-   III: condition of elements is unknown.

Also, the readings along the acoustic axis, regardless of the region
affected, are more likely to be correct than on the edges.

The actual translation of the model into a numeric values is, however,
not consensued, and will be decided by the algorithm in use.
