# Design Patterns - Chain of Responsibility

Avoid coupling the sender and the receiver of a request by creating and
giving more objects the opportunity to process the request and the
option to pass to the next in the chain the request.

If Obj A knows how to handle the request it does so. If not, Obj A calls
Obj B, that calls obj Câ€¦ Until one object knows hot to handle the
request.
