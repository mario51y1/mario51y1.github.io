# Robotics Basics - Navigation

Although having a simple definition, which is, finding the way in the
environment to a certain place, **navigation** is one of the most
important tasks and problem that the robotics field has studied and
worked on. Navigation has a lot of minor problems/tasks that have to be
accomplished in order to properly navigate the environment:

-   Localization: finding where you are [20220209185424](/notes/20220209185424)
-   Search: looking at the goal location
-   Path planning: planning how to reach the goal [20220209185522](/notes/20220209185522)
-   Coverage: covering all of an area [20220209185811](/notes/20220209185811)
-   SLAM: localization and mapping at the same time

-   Exploration: finding where I haven’t been [20220309201750](/notes/20220309201750)
