# Design Patterns - Template Method

Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, using some steps
that are defined by methods. Subclasses will use this step methods to
implement the main algorithm.

MainClass has MainOper(), Oper1(), Oper2(), Oper3(). MainOper is defined
using Oper1,2,3, but subclasses implement these methods, defining the
algorithm.
