# Robotics Basics - Hybrid Architecture

Hybrid architectures are a combination of deliberative
[20210711201454](/notes/20210711201454) and reactive [20210711201545](/notes/20210711201545)
architectures. There is a middle layer between both parts that links
them together and decides whether to choose one or another or a mixture
of both to select the actions to perform.

           Planning Layer
            Middle Layer

Sense —&gt; Reactive Layer —&gt; Act

The challenge in this architectures is, then, to achieve the right
compromise between these two layers. This is, indeed, a hard task, but
this middle layer allows us to perform thing such as:

-   Deal with changes in the world when reactive architectures can’t
    proceed
-   Create a plan and follow it until reactive can’t proceed, and the
    replan.
-   Avoid constantly replaning by storing plans as intermediate actions
-   Pre-plan things in advance
