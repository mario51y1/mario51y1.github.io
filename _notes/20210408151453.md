# Design Patterns - Bridge

Used when you want to decouple an abstraction from itâ€™s implementation
so both can vary independently.

For example, a Window class can work in Linux using XWindows or Windows
using PMWindow. New classes that inherit from window have to implement
another two classes for either Linux ir Windows. You can separate this
so the concrete window class uses an Implementation class, and operate
using the Implementation class method.
