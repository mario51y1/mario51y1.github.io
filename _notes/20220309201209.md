# Feature based localization

Feature based localization [20220209185424](/notes/20220209185424) relies on detecting
features on the environment to then locate the robot on relation to this
features. There are two mayor types of feature based localization:

-   Extract the features from the environment, mapping them and then try
    to locate on relation to these features.
-   Localize the robot to a set of topological features
