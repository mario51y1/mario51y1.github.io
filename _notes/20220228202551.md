# Using sensor models for interpreting sensor readings

When interpreting the measurements of a sensor, you need also to address
the uncertainty that is on the sensor measurements, for example, when a
sonar sensor detects a reading at a distance X if that reading is really
an obstacle or if it can be a false reading, address itâ€™s accuracy.
Sensor models are a way to address this issue by describing how to
interpret a sensor measurement.

Sensor models can be generated using certain techniques:

-   Empirical methods: by testing sensor data
-   Analytical methods: by understanding the physical properties of the
    physical device
-   Subjective methods: based on the designer experience.

An example of a sensor model commonly used is the sonar sensor model
