# Comparing intelligence on agents with computational theory

In order to compare different kinds of agents [20211217203347](/notes/20211217203347) we
can try to compare what they have in common. In order to do so, David
Marr defined a set of levels to compare them on what is usually called
computational theory.

Greatly simplified, this levels are:

1.  **Existence proof of what can/should be done**. On this levels
    agents can share a purpose or functionality, such as search for
    humans (mosquitos do, and so can robots).
2.  **Decomposition of what into inputs, outputs and transformations.**
    Agents can share common processes here, input to output
    transformations. For example, a mosquito senses heat to detect
    humans but also can robots.
3.  **How to implement the process.** Agents usually share little to no
    commonality on this level (mosquitos fly to the position and robots
    can use wheels).
