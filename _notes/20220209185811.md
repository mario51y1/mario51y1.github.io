# Robot navigation - coverage

Covering an area can be a problem here you have or not a map. If you
have a map, this becomes a search problem, which has been studied in the
field of Computer Science and AI and has some ways to solve it, but
rather slowly. if you have not, then the robot has to move on a
systematic way to cover all the environment, which can be very difficult
as the environment may have very complex areas.
