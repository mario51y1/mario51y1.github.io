# Internal navigation systems - INS

Internal navigation system, INS, is a system commonly used in aircraft,
submarines or missiles to measure movement through internal
accelerometers, which provides very precise measures of distance
traveled. This technology, however, is not very suitable for robotics
because:

-   They are usually ver big
-   They are very expensive
-   Robots do not always have a smooth movement, which makes the
    accelerometers introduce errors
