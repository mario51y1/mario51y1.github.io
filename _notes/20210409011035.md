# Design Patterns - Command

Encapsulate a request in an object so you can parameterize every aspect
of it, like the sender or the receiver, type of request, etc.

This can be very handy if you want to enable the option to ‘Undo’
operations. You implement an Undo operation in every command, and store
the commands somewhere where it can be retrieved. You probably will need
the context or snapshot of the state of the program to be able to undo
things too, for example, by using the “Memento” pattern.
