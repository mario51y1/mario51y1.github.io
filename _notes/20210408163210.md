# Design Patterns - Facade

Provide an interface to access several other interfaces of a subsystem,
grouping them together and giving a single point of access to it.

When you have a subset of interfaces that work together to do some task,
for example, you could create a general interface that provides access
to the whole task by calling a single method, but internally, it works
with all the sub-interfaces of the system.
