# Robot navigation - path planing

To perform path planning, the robot needs to know both it’s location and
the location of the goal in the environment, and if those are both
known, finding a path it’s a well understood problem, What it’s
difficult it’s to achieve the most optimal path, which can be very time
consuming, and sometimes it’s not even taken in consideration as long as
a path to achieve the goal is computed. Other times, the path computed
it’s not to the final goal but to a more near place in the map, and it’s
calculated in batches until the final goal is achieved.

Path planning can be performed either by qualitative methods
