# On designing a sensor suit for a robot

Many different aspects have to be taken in consideration when designing
a sensors suit for a robot, in order to accomplish the task that the
robot has to perform on the given constraints, such as the budget or
dimensions of the robot. Specific sensor attributes to be considered,
but not limited to, are:

-   Field of view of the robot
-   Accuracy, repetability and resolution
-   Responsiveness in the target domain
-   Power consumption
-   Hardware reliability
-   Size
-   Computational complexity
-   Interpretation reliability

However, when designing a whole suit, other attribute have to been
considered as a whole. Three common ones are:

-   Simplicity: it is better to use sensors as simple as posible.
-   Modularity: to make replacement more easy without breaking other
    parts of the code
-   Redundancy: some applications may need a higher degree of
    redundancy, like militar or space robots
