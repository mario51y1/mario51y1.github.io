# Robot navigation - SLAM

SLAM it’s a really hard problem in the field, as it has to perform two
processes simultaneously: figuring out where you are and constructing
the map of the environment. The major problem here is the difficulty on
differentiating very similar places that can be considered as ambiguos.
