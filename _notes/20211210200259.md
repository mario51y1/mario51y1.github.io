# The major drawbacks and problems of the deliberative paradigm are its costs and portability/modularity

The costs of the deliberative paradigm, both computational and memory
related, are too high as planning requires many complex calculations:

-   Getting a plan for a real environment can be very slow, as it
    requires a lot of computation.
-   Getting a plan for a real environment requires a lot of memory in
    the controller.
-   Getting a plan for a real environment requires that the world model
    is accurate, so it has to be updated, which requires more time.
-   Executing such a complex plan is not a trivial task.

There are other problems, however, that also have to be taken in
consideration:

-   The sense and act phases are always disconnected.
-   There is a heavy dependence on the world model. Changes on the
    environment require an update, which makes the whole process more
    expensive.
-   The execution of the plan makes the robot more vulnerable to the
    uncertainty of the environment.
