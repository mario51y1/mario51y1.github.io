# Range extraction in computer vision

-   **Stereo cameras**: use two cameras to take two pictures and compute
    distances by matching points on both images. It’s main disadvantage
    is that is a computationally expensive.
-   **Light stripes**: project some lines on the environment and with
    the cameras see how they distort to get information. It’s main
    disadvantage is that they perform okey on labs and closed
    environments, but not very well on the outside.
-   **Laser ranging**: use a laser beam to scan the environment to
    produce depth values, and use all this values to create a
    intensity/depth image. It’s main disadvantage are that laser can be
    quite expensive and are more susceptible to light
    reflection/absorption than when dealing with camera images.
-   **Texture**: sometimes, on certain tasks for example, on robotics
    [20210602191112](/notes/20210602191112), there are more simple and elegant solutions
    like detecting some textures on the environment to define depth.
