# Robotics Effectors and Actuators - Basics

We can difference between two types of devices that enable the robot to
take action:

-   Effector: a device that has an effect in the enviroment
-   Actuator: mechanism that effectors use to take action

If we compare, a leg would be an effector, and the muscle that make the
leg move would be the actuator. Similarly, a wheel would be an effector
and the motor that moves the wheel would be the actuator. These
actuators can be passive or active, but the more usual ones are the
active ones. These can be:

-   Electric motors [20210516201246](/notes/20210516201246)
-   Hydraulic
-   Pneumatic
-   Photo-reactive
-   Chemically reactive
-   Piroelectric?

Robotic effectors and actuators are used to perform two main tasks:
locomotion [20210516201347](/notes/20210516201347), the movement in the world, and object
manipulation [20210516201504](/notes/20210516201504).

The movement in a space is determined by the Degrees of Freedom of the
robot. [20210516203846](/notes/20210516203846)
