# Robotics Basics - Behavior-Based Architecture

Behavior-based architectures grew out of reactive control architectures
[20210711201545](/notes/20210711201545), and was inspired by biological systems. In
behavior-based architectures, the system is composed as a collection of
behaviors, which have the following characteristics:

-   Achieve or maintain a goal
-   They are time extended
-   Can take input from sensors or from other behaviors
-   They are more complex than actions

These behaviors can be implemented form different levels of abstraction,
for example, you can have the “Avoid objects” behavior and another one
“Find path.”

In behavior-based architectures, you have the following principles:

-   Behaviors are executed in parallel
-   Networks of behaviors are used to store state and world models
-   Behaviors operate at different time-scales

With these principles, behavior-based systems are not limited in some
ways that hybrid systems are. Instead, they have the following key
properties:

-   Ability to react in real time
-   Ability to store and use representations to generate efficient
    behavior
-   Ability to use an uniform structure and representation through the
    whole system.

Another key property of the systems is that there are complex behaviors
that can appear from the combination of simple ones, sometimes
unexpectedly, which are called **emergent behaviors**.

## Behavior Coordination

As in reactive architectures [20210711201545](/notes/20210711201545), the next behavior
can be selected from either arbitrary choice or by fusion.

-   Arbitrary: only one behavior is performed, selected from multiple
    choices. The priority can be fixed or can dynamically change.
-   Fusion: multiple behaviors are combined together into a single
    output, which can be tricky as some behaviors may not be possible to
    merge together as conflict arises.
