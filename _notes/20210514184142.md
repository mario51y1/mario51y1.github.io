# What is a robot

A robot is an autonomous system that exists in the physical world and
that can sense the environment and act on it to achieve some kind of
goal. A key aspect of robotics is this existence/sense/acting in the
real world, which leads to many of the problems and areas of research in
the field. This also makes robots a type of intelligent agent

Robotics is the result of many different areas of research and different
topics. Mainly we can talk about:

-   Cybernetics:the integration of sensing, action in an environment
-   Control theory: the math used for controlling machines
-   AI: the mechanisms for planning and reasoning

A robot has 4 main components:

-   **Physical body**: makes the robot exist in the environment and to
    attach the other parts
-   [20210514185016](/notes/20210514185016) **Sensors**: provide information about the
    environment
-   [20210514185045](/notes/20210514185045) **Effectors / Actuators**: enable the robot
    to perform action
-   [20210514185436](/notes/20210514185436) **Controllers**: provides autonomy to the
    robot
