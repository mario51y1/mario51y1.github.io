# Robotics Basics - Deliberative Architecture

Deliberative architectures focuses on thinking really hard and ahead on
the future to create a big plan to follow. This implies looking ahead at
the outcome of the possible actions and to search for the sequence that
makes the robot achieve the desired goal, making the decision a **search
problem**: looking in the representation of a problem for a desired
state and storing the actions to achieve it. This search problem can be
**optimized**, that is, choosing between actions for the best one
according to some criteria.

**Sense –&gt; Plan –&gt; Action **

Pure deliberative architectures are not frequently used, mainly because
of the following drawbacks.

## Drawbacks

-   Getting a plan for a real environment can be very slow, as it
    requires a lot of computation.
-   Getting a plan for a real environment requires a lot of memory in
    the controller.
-   Getting a plan for a real environment requires that the world model
    is accurate, so it has to be updated, which requires more time.
-   Executing such a complex plan is not a trivial task.
