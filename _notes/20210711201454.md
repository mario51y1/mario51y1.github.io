# Robotics Basics - Deliberative Paradigm

The deliberative paradigm focuses on thinking on advance and ahead on
the future to create a big plan to follow. This implies looking ahead at
the outcome of the possible actions and to search for the sequence that
makes the robot achieve the desired goal, making the decision a **search
problem**: looking in the representation of a problem for a desired
state and storing the actions to achieve it. This search problem can be
**optimized**, that is, choosing between actions for the best one
according to some criteria.

**Sense –&gt; Plan –&gt; Action **

The first architectures of the deliberative paradigm showed to the
robotics community two major problems that had to be considered on the
development of robotics: the closed world assumption
[20211210202959](/notes/20211210202959) and the frame problem [20211210204216](/notes/20211210204216).

Pure deliberative architectures are not frequently used, mainly because
they require heavy computation and memory costs and they are very niche
targeted [20211210200259](/notes/20211210200259).
