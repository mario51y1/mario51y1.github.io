# Iconic localization and map making

Iconic localization [20220209185424](/notes/20220209185424) and map making is based on
the usage of and occupancy grid, a representation of the world where
obstacles are marked on the grid. This kind of localization usually
relies on the usage of a sensor model [20220228202551](/notes/20220228202551) to update
the map, usually a sonar sensor model [20220228203000](/notes/20220228203000).

There are a few algorithms based on iconic localization:

-   Bayes [20220301203202](/notes/20220301203202)
-   Dempster-shafter [20220301204533](/notes/20220301204533)
-   HIMM [20220301204755](/notes/20220301204755)

Bayes and Dempster-shafter are formal theories, where other sensor
readings can be more easily fused into the sonar model. HIMM is only
suitable for sonar. They are also more easily adaptable to new
environments than HIMM. However, HIMM has a greater computational
advantage over this theories with good results.
