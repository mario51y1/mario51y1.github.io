# GPS

GPS calculates the position of a receiver by triangulation, using
information provided by satellites. The minimum information needed to
calculate the position is 4, but more measurements allows to reduce the
error of the measurements and provides a more precise position.

Another technique used to reduce the error is DGPS (Differential GPS),
which uses two receivers where one stays stationary.

GPS is only suitable in robotics for outdoor robots.
