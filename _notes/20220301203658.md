# Probabilities basics

A probability function scores evidence on a 0 to 1 scale of an event *H*
on a given experiment. *P*(*H*) is the probability that *H* has
occurred, and *P*(¬*H*) is that it didn’t happen, and
1 − *P*(*H*) = *P*(¬*H*).

Both of those are unconditional probabilities, if we want to compute the
probability of something given some other condition we refer to those as
conditional probabilities, in the form of *P*(*H*|*s*), where *s*
corresponds to a given condition.
