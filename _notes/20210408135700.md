# Design Patterns - Abstract Factory

Provide an interface for the creation of families of related objects
without specifying their concrete class inside the family.

You have many factories, each one for a concrete family of related
objects. You instantiate the concrete factory, and call the method to
create the object, but the responsibility of which object to create is
in the concrete factory, the client doesnâ€™t know.
