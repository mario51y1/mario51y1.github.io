# Computer Vision - Segmentation

Segmentation is the process of dividing the image in parts that
correspond to continuous objects. This can be achieved in many ways:

-   Model Based Vision: compare what is detected with stored models.
    Usually needs to perform a lot of calculations and transformations
    to the image.
-   Motion vision: use motion to facilitate visual processing.
-   Stereo vision: use combine points of view to reconstruct 3D objects.
-   Texture, shading and contour processing.
