# The Closed World Assumption Problem

When using a world model, this needs, in order to the robot to behave
properly, to have all the information needed for the problem, to make
sure that there are no surprises when making calculations and deciding
how to behave. However, on many domains and problems, this task becomes
imposible, as there are many different details to be taken in
consideration and is very probable to forget some of them.

Furthermore, even with a perfect representation of the world, the world
model would become so big that, in order to process all the information,
the computational cost of processing all this information would make the
task unrealistic.

These problems came up to the robotics community with the STRIPS
architecture [20211215193324](/notes/20211215193324) in conjunction with the frame
problem [20211210204216](/notes/20211210204216).
