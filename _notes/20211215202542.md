# NHC Architecture

The NHC architecture was an architecture that implemented the
deliberative paradigm. It’s main contribution was it’s decomposition of
the PLAN phase on 3 different subsystems, which aimed to support
navigation:

-   Mission Planner: takes the current mission and decomposes it on
    terms that the other functions can understand. Then, accesses the
    world model and sets the goal to the navigator.
-   Navigator: generates the path from the current location to the goal.
    Generates a set of waypoints that are passed to the Pilot.
-   Pilot: takes the first line/segment of the path and translates this
    into actions for the robot, which are performed by the low-level
    controllers.
