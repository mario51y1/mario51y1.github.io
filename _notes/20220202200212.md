# Logic sensors abstractions and behaviors

We can use an abstraction of sensors [20210514185016](/notes/20210514185016) in order to
use them with behaviors as a perceptual schema [20220126192156](/notes/20220126192156). A
logic sensors will supply a particular percept, but how does it obtain
this percept can be defined with different sensors or time-frames. For
example, a polar plot around the robot, in order to detect obstacles,
can be obtained either rapidly using a sonar sensor or on a longer but
more precise way by using a camera.
