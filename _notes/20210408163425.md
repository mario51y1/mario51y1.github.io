# Design Patterns - Flyweight

Use sharing to support large numbers of objects with fine-grain access
to other objects, reducing the resources needed for the large amount of
objects.

A shared object can be used in multiple context, and itâ€™s used in many
parts of the program, YOu can then create a shared object that represent
the part that is in every object and surround that with an object that
represents the context, so you could have many context objects pointing
to the same shared object.
