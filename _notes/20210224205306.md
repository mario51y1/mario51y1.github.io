### Creating permanent notes should take some effort

The main idea behind permanent notes is that it should be the result of
processing information and use this information to generate knowledge.
In order to do so, you need to follow some guidelines:

-   Always use your own words and ideas. You can reference –note to
    references– as many sources as needed (0..N) if you feel you need
    to, but the text should be redacted by yourself.
-   Try to create notes as atomic as posible. You want to stick to one
    knowledge unit, and use connection to relate different knowledge
    units and generate new knowledge [20210224210526](/notes/20210224210526).

This means that, in order to properly take notes, you have to focus on
it. Is not collecting information and dumping it on a note that you may
never see again thinking that it could be useful some day. Gathering
information only doesn’t generate knowledge.
