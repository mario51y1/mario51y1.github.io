# Design Patterns - Proxy

Provide a surrogate or placeholder object for another object to control
access to it.

Can be used in many context or situations, for example:

-   If you have images that are large and slow the system, you can have
    a proxy that serves as a placeholder and load the image only when
    needed.
-   Access to remote objects
-   Virtual or expensive objects
-   Protection / Security
-   Perform additional actions to objects.
