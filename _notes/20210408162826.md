# Design Patterns - Decorator

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically by adding
other objects to it. Provides a flexible alternative to extend
functionality to class hierarchies and inheritance.

An object has a list of decorators to add extra responsibilities, and
when called, uses the added objects to add the extended stuff. For
example, a decorator could be an object that adds a border to other one,
so you could create a bordered window by adding the decorator to the
window object.
