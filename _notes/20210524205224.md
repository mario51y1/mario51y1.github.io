# Robotics Light sensors - Basics

Light sensors measure the amount of light that impacts a photocell, a
device that has a low resistance when there is light impacting on it.
Although this is the basic functioning of a light sensor, we can have
other variations that are very commonly used:

-   Polarized sensors: they only detect the light that comes from a
    certain direction.
-   Reflective Optosensors: they are a type of active sensor, using a
    light sensor with a light emitter.
    -   Reflectance optosensor: light is emitted and if it reflects with
        something in front is detected by the light sensor
    -   Break-beam: a light beam goes from emitter to sensor, and they
        detect when something comes between.

These reflective sensors have a problem: the light is reflected
depending on many physical qualities of the surface, like the color,
distance, if it’s or not a shiny surface… Infra red sensors are commonly
used to deal with this problems since they are less prone to
interference. [20210524205426](/notes/20210524205426)
