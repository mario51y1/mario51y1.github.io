# Laser Sensors - Basics

Laser sensors work using a highly amplified and coherent radiation at
one or more frequencies, in a similar way that sonar use sound.
[20210602190915](/notes/20210602190915). They donâ€™t use time-of-flight measures, since
light travels way faster that sound. They use phase-shift to calculate
the distance.

Lasers are not affected by specular reflection, in contrast to sonar
sensors, and are more accurate that sonars. In contrast, laser sensors
are bigger than sonars, require more power to operate and are more
expensive that sonars.
