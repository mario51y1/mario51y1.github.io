# The frame problem (representation)

The frame problem states that a world representation has to be
computationally tractable to work properly. This means that, in order to
properly behave, there has to be an adequate set of rules and axioms
specified to properly track changes in the world, as no arbitrary change
can happen. This set of axioms also increases the amount of them needed
to represent the world and the computation cost of updating a world
model.

The frame problem came up to the robotics community with the STRIPS
architecture [20211215193324](/notes/20211215193324) in conjunction with the closed world
assumption problem [20211210202959](/notes/20211210202959).
