# Robotics Basics - Control Architectures

Feedback Control [20210709201550](/notes/20210709201550) is a great way to tell a
controller how to perform a single behavior and to keep that behavior.
However, we need a way to select the best behaviour to achieve our
current goal, and this is the job of the **Control Architecture**.

Control architecture is the set of guiding principles and constraints
for organizing the robot control system. There are different paradigms
for robot architecture, which can have many different types of specific
architectures:

-   Deliberative [20210711201454](/notes/20210711201454)
-   Reactive [20210711201545](/notes/20210711201545)
-   Hybrid [20210711201605](/notes/20210711201605)
-   Behavior-based [20210711201636](/notes/20210711201636)

These architectures types differ in three major aspects:

-   Time: how fast has the robot to respond and how quickly it senses
-   Modularity: how the system is divided in pieces and how they
    interact with each other
-   Representation: how information is stored/encoded
