# Robotics Basics - Control Paradigms

Feedback Control [20210709201550](/notes/20210709201550) is a great way to tell a
controller how to perform a single behavior and to keep that behavior.
However, we need a way to select the best behavior to achieve our
current goal, and this is the job of the **Control architecture**.

A **paradigm** is a set of assumptions and techniques which are used to
characterize a certain problem. An **architecture** is a set of
different architectural component and itâ€™s interaction, and they are
used to describe how to apply a paradigm, specifying the concrete
elements.

There are different paradigms for robot control, which can have many
different types of specific architectures:

-   Deliberative/Hierarchical [20210711201454](/notes/20210711201454)
-   Reactive [20210711201545](/notes/20210711201545)
-   Hybrid [20210711201605](/notes/20210711201605)

These paradigms types differ in three major aspects:

-   Time: how fast has the robot to respond and how quickly it senses
-   Modularity: how the system is divided in pieces and how they
    interact with each other
-   Representation: how information is stored/encoded
