# Cameras and Computer vision in Robotics - Basics

Vision is, indeed, a very complex problem and not only in robotics. It
is considered a topic on itself, and it is mostly a computation problem,
as you receive light levels and you need to process those levels to
obtain information. In robotics, this information is needed in order to
take action.

There is an specific index for this topic. [20210709195051](/notes/20210709195051)

## Cameras

Cameras are built trying to imitate how eyes work. Light comes through
an opening, a pinhole or a lens, and hit an image plane where some
photosensitive elements detect it and mesure it.

-   Lens provide more light at the expense of having objects out of
    focus – depth of field.
-   The image plane is divided in pixels, which form the final image
    that has to be processed.

## Basic processing and operations

-   Edge detection [20210709194941](/notes/20210709194941)
-   Smoothing [20210709195610](/notes/20210709195610)
-   Segmentation [20210709195948](/notes/20210709195948)

In robot vision, we need to simplify things in order to quickly process
the information that we need and respond accordingly. Full image
processing using complex techniques can’t be done, some of the
alternatives being:

-   Use of color
-   Use of color and movement
-   Use a small image plane
-   Combine other sensors with vision
-   Use knowledge of the environment
