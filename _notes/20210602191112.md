# Cameras and Computer vision in Robotics - Basics

Vision is, indeed, a very complex problem and not only in robotics. It
is considered a topic on itself, and it is mostly a computation problem,
as you receive light levels and you need to process those levels to
obtain information. In robotics, this information is needed in order to
take action. Robots can have many different cameras
[20220204192135](/notes/20220204192135).

There is an specific index for this topic. [20210709195051](/notes/20210709195051)

## Basic processing and operations

There are some basic techniques in computer vision that are used in
robotics:

-   Edge detection [20210709194941](/notes/20210709194941)
-   Smoothing [20210709195610](/notes/20210709195610)
-   Segmentation [20210709195948](/notes/20210709195948)
-   Range extraction [20220204191818](/notes/20220204191818)

However, in robotic vision, we need to simplify things in order to
quickly process the information that we need in order to respond
accordingly. Full image processing using complex techniques can’t be
done, some of the alternatives being:

-   Use of color, very common on reactive robots [20220204185448](/notes/20220204185448)
-   Use of color and movement
-   Use a small image plane
-   Combine other sensors with vision
-   Use knowledge of the environment
