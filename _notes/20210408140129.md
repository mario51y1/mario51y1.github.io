# Design Patterns - Builder

Separate the construction of an object from itâ€™s representation, so the
same process can be used to generate different representations.

A builder class creates parts, and a director class calls the builder to
create a concrete part. The client then creates a director and retrieves
the object when completed from it, ignoring the build process.
