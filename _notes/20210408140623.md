# Design Patterns - Prototype

Specify the kind of object that you want to create by using a
prototypical instance, and then, when ypui want the object, you just
call a copy method to retrieve the object.

This is useful when the class is specified at runtime, as it can be
created, assigned and then copied using the pattern.
