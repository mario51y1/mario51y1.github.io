# Topological path planning

Topological path planning represents the space in terms of connections
between landmarks on the **environment**, this is, a perceptually
distinctive feature of the environment. This representations can be
either relational [20220221202140](/notes/20220221202140) (graph style representation) or
associative [20220221202405](/notes/20220221202405) (couple sensing with the location).

-   Landmarks are used to locate the robot on the environment.
-   **Gateways** are a special kind of landmarks, one where the robot
    can change its direction of navigation, making itâ€™s detection a
    crucial task.
-   Landmarks can be **artificial** (some features are added to an
    existing object) or natural (already existing, although not designed
    for perception).
-   Landmarks need to be easily recognizable, need to support the task
    dependent activity and need to be perceivable from different
    viewpoints.
