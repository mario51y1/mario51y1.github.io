# Design patterns

A pattern is a problem that repeats over and over again. A design
pattern is a pattern in the context of software design, this is, the
process of designing a new system to fulfill some requirements. At it’s
core, a design pattern is the explanation of a common problem and it’s
general solution.

When talking about design patterns, we can classify them by its main
motivation/scope:

-   Creational: class and object creation
    -   Create a system that works independently of how its classes and
        objects are created.
-   Structural: class and object composition
    -   How classes and objects are composed to create larger and more
        complex structures.
-   Behavioral: class and object interaction
    -   Describe algorithms, communication protocols, etc, using classes
        and objects to encapsulate this knowledge and behaviors.

Full list of patterns, as described in Design Patterns book, is the
following:
