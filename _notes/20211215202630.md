# NIST RCS Architecture

NIST RCS was an architecture that implemented the deliberative paradigm.
It was similar to the NHC architecture [20211215202542](/notes/20211215202542) but added
some components such as:

-   SENSE activities updated the world model, but between the direct
    output and the world model, it added a new step which was feature
    extraction that transformed the readings into new information.
-   On the PLAN phase, a Value Judgement module was used to simulate
    that the plan to ensure that it will work properly. Actions, if
    verified, where passed to a Behavior Generator which translated them
    into specific actions for a low-level controller.

This architecture was adopted successfully by many governments agencies,
such as NASA.
