# Properly linking notes to reinforce what you learn and generate new ideas

When you have finished writing a permanent note, you have to go through
your Zettlekasten to properly connect that note to the other ones that
you have. With this, you reinforce the connection with other different
pieces of knowledge and you make easier to generate new ideas and help
your brain to make connections.

Nonetheless, it is very, very important to give context when you add a
reference to another note, primary because of two things:

-   You help your future self, as the connection may be clear when you
    make the note but cannot be true when rereading a note.
-   You donâ€™t generate knowledge, you just gather facts and information
    together. Context helps with the creation of relationships between
    notes, therefore helps the creation of new knowledge.
