# Robotics Sensors - Basics

Sensors are devices in the robot used to measure properties of the
world, either of the robot or of the environment. It’s very important to
take in consideration that this measurements of the environment have to
be computed to obtain actual information, and this is called sensor
processing. The transformation from sensor output to intelligent
responses is called signal-to-symbol.

The biggest deal when measuring the environment is called uncertainty.
We are unable to be sure about the state of the world and the robot,
since every sensor has in it’s measurement some error and noise.

## Elements to process sensors

There is some elements needed to process the sensor data:

-   Support electronics
-   Batteries
-   Wires
-   Analog/digital processing capabilities (a computer)

Usually, we think in terms of sensing as a systems that has:

-   A task to perform
-   Sensors suited to perform that task
-   The mechanical design to support the system

Many different sensors exist right now, from simple
[20210523205724](/notes/20210523205724) to very complex ones [20210523205908](/notes/20210523205908), and
the more complex they are, the more processing is needed.
