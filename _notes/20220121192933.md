# Sensor fusion

Sensor fusion is a technique that combines information from various
sensors into a single percept [20220126192156](/notes/20220126192156). We can use this
technique to obtain more rich, precise or redundant information, as this
technique can provide:

-   Redundancy. Using more than one sensors provides us with more
    information and can allow us to detect false positives or false
    negatives. This can be provided physically, using more than one
    sensors or logically, by using more than one algorithm to obtain
    information.
-   Complementary information. Some sensor can provide different
    information which used together allows us to create a better
    percept.
