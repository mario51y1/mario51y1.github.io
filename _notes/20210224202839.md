# Zettlekasten 101

The Zettlekasten method is a system to organize your notes to create a
web of thoughts and ideas that you can travel. The main idea is that you
organize your notes where every note represents one idea and you connect
notes with each other so you can travel the net.

The process could be explained as the following steps:

-   Read something. Then take notes of that, with your thoughts and
    ideas, create temporary notes
-   Take some time of the day to process those notes
-   Read through them, get what is useful and throw what is not
-   Create permanent notes. This is one of the most important part of
    the actual process and should take time if done properly as it is
    not merely a dumping info process [20210224205306](/notes/20210224205306).
-   Go through previous notes and link the new note if it is necessary.
    This is the main way to create knowledge with the Zettlekasten, and
    should always have context [20210224210526](/notes/20210224210526).

Additionally to permanent notes, some extra notes or features can be
used:

-   Literature notes: on things read, if you want to keep them. Only
    specific about the book
-   Index notes
-   Reference system
-   Tags â€“ note on tags and the need to be careful
-   Inbox
