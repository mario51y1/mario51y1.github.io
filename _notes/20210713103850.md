# Robotics - Emergent Behaviors

In behavior-based architectures [20211217202757](/notes/20211217202757), from the
combination of simple behaviors sometimes other complex and unexpected
behaviors can emerge, performing tasks that are greater than the sum of
it’s parts.

In order to enable this emergence to happen, it’s necessary that we
observe the robot and we have access to the controller to verify that
those are behaviors that were not there programmed.

Of course, there is good and bad emergent behavior, and we should try to
exploit the good ones and remove the bad ones.
