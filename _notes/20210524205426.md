# Robotics Infra-red sensors

Infra-red sensors work in the same way as light sensors
[20210524205224](/notes/20210524205224) but they operate in a frequency band that is not
visible for the human eye. They are very commonly used in robotics
because the modulation of the light is very easy to achieve, and because
the are less prone to interference.

Infra red sensors are used in a break-beam mechanism with motors to keep
track of the rotation of this one.

## Modulation

Modulation of light is achieved by rapidly turning on and off the light,
transforming the frequency to a particular one that can be used to code
information.
