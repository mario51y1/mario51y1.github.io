# Robotics Basics - Group Robotics

When you are dealing with not one but many robots at the same time,
there are new problems and difficulties that arise from this fact.
Robotics groups, also, have to deal with two tasks that appear when
working in groups:

-   Coordination: arranging things in a certain order.
-   Cooperation: joint actions to achieve a mutual benefit

There are, of course, advantages and disadvantages when working within a
group:

-   They can perform actions that couldn’t be achieved alone
-   They can perform actions in a more efficiently and better than alone
-   They can be at many places at the same time
-   The robustness increases

Some of the disadvantages are:

-   Dealing with interference between robots
-   Deal with problems in communication, both physical and logistically
-   Increased uncertainty and complexity on the environment
-   Increased hardware cost

## Types of groups

Differences in the role of the robots:

-   Homogeneous
-   Heterogeneous

Differences in how the robots coordinate:

-   Merely coexisting: they work in the same environment, without
    communication
-   Loosely coupled: they perform simple coordination but they don’t
    depend on each other
-   Tightly coupled: complex coordination/cooperation, with dependency
    on each other

Control of the group can also be either centralized or distributed.

## Communication types

-   Explicit: the robots send explicit messages between each other. This
    can be achieved in many ways, such as peer-to-peer, broadcasting,
    publisher-subscriber…
-   Implicit: each robots leaves the information in the environment
    without using an explicit channel so the other robots can sense and
    receive it.
