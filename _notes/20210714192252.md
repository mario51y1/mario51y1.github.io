# Robotics Basics - Group Robotics

Group robotics are considered a multi-agent system
[20220209180627](/notes/20220209180627). Multi-agent systems in robotics are used because
they can provide some advantages over using a single robot, like:

-   More suitable to accomplish certain tasks, like covering an area.
-   Provide redundancy
-   Can decrease cost-effectiveness

Robotics multi-agent systems have, of course, the same problems as these
system have, on top of some others like:

-   Robots interfering in the real world together
-   Physical constraints and problems

The usage on these systems of robot behaviors [20211217202757](/notes/20211217202757) can
also produce the appearance of social behaviors on an emergent way
[20210713103850](/notes/20210713103850).
